Rules v0
========

.. A *NetCDF-4 file* is a said a valid *POEM File* with version 0 if it complies with the following set of RULES:

.. warning::
    Many POEM v0 files have been generated by D-ICE with POEM library or not but this was anterior to the official
    open source release of the POEM library. As such, POEM Library is able to read POEM Files V0. However, as public
    version of the POEM library started at V1, we do not provide RULES for v0 as none is likely to use this
    specification version.

    V0 reading capabilities of POEM Library may be not ensured anymore in the future, without any notice. We will do our
    best to ensure that this will be the only one exception to the :ref:`compatibility_policy`.
