========================================
Performance pOlar Exchange forMat (POEM)
========================================

This document describes the **POEM File Format Specifications**. It is proposed by *D-ICE ENGINEERING*
to the Wind-Propulsion community. It is intended to provide a common efficient solution to store and
manipulate multidimensional polar data tables generated by Performance Prediction Programs or
other means and read by Weather Routing solutions.

* **POEM Files** ARE purely *NetCDF-4* (https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) files and are I/O compatible
  with any library that deals with *NetCDF-4 standards*.
* **POEM File Format Specifications* introduce a set of rules to organise data into a *NetCDF-4* file to make a valid **POEM
  File**, understood by the **POEM Library**.
* **POEM Library** is a C++ library that defines data structures to be integrated into applicative
  software such as VPP/PPP software to generate performance polar tables, visualisation
  software, weather routing solutions, embedded systems etc. It also provides fast algorithms
  to interpolate on multidimensional polar tables.
* **POEM Executable** is a command line utility to manipulate POEM files (clean, gerify version compliance etc...)
