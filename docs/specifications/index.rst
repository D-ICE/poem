===========================================
Performance pOlar intErchange forMat (POEM)
===========================================

This document describes the **POEM File Format Specifications**. It is proposed by *D-ICE ENGINEERING*
to the Wind-Propulsion community. It is intended to provide a common efficient solution to store and
manipulate multidimensional polar data tables generated by Performance Prediction Programs or
other means and read by weather routing solutions.

* **POEM files** ARE purely *NetCDF-4* (https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) files and are I/O compatible
  with any library that deals with *NetCDF-4 standards*.
* **POEM File Format Specifications* introduce a set of rules to organise data into a *NetCDF-4* file to make a valid **POEM
  File**, understood by the **POEM Library**.
* POEM library is a C++ library that defines data structures to be integrated into applicative
  software such as VPP/PPP software to generate performance polar tables, visualisation
  software, weather routing solutions, embedded systems etc. It also provides fast algorithms
  to interpolate on multidimensional polar tables.

.. warning::
   This document is preliminary, not publicly available (yet) and has been shared with you upon request.
   A version of this document is currently under active development along with extended POEM File Format Specifications. It will be made freely available to anyone in the frame of the ADEME-funded project OPERVENT, by late 2024.

   Please DO NOT SHARE the present document unless you get written permission from D-ICE ENGINEERING.

   For any questions, please contact François Rongère <francois.rongere@dice-engineering.com>

.. note::
   The **POEM File Format Specifiations** described in the present document only define RULES to manage PPP performance
   polar tables, i.e. for Power Prediction with Speed control. The future version under development will define RULES to
   manage any type of control into a single POEM file.
   Specifications are given for 5-Dimensional PPP performance polar tables currently used at D-ICE ENGINEERING.
   The future version will provide much more flexibility.
