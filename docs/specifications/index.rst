POEM: Performance pOlar Exchange forMat
=======================================

This document describes the **POEM File Format Specifications**.
It is proposed by `D-ICE ENGINEERING <https://www.dice-engineering.com/en>`_ to the Wind-Propulsion community and
is intended to provide a common efficient solution to store and manipulate multidimensional polar data tables
generated by Performance Prediction Programs or other means and used by Weather Routing optimization software,
embedded control systems, training simulators.
